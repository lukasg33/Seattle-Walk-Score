    "The dataset I'm using is based on 1000 random coordinates within the Seattle city limits. Based on these 1000 random coordinates, I merged on demographic data from the census tract that encompasses the coordinates. To round out the feature set, I definied a ammenity and distance combinations that I thought would be imporant for walkability. I queried these combinations using the Location IQ API. Then I tried to evaluate the surrounding street network within .25 km these points. I used the Open Street Maps API for this. Lastly, I merged information about the zoning features of the randomly generated points from data downloaded from the City of Seattle. "
